        <p>This picture, which is in effect drawn directly with paint, was
                almost certainly executed out-of-doors about 1870. The site is
                in the village of Louveciennes, west of Paris, where Camille
                Pissarro lived and worked in 1869-70 and was inspired to paint
                the same motif, but from a different vantage point (National
                Gallery, London). At the time, Renoir was staying nearby with
                his parents, who had retired to Voisins.

                        Nicolaes van Veerendael, 1662

        <p>Van Veerendael was influenced by two of the leading flower
                painters in Antwerp, Jan Davidsz de Heem and Daniel Seghers. In
                this early work the evidence of acute observation seems a legacy
                of De Heem's Dutch origins, but the overall design and dwelling
                upon botanical details continue the Flemish tradition of Segher's
                master, Jan Brueghel the Elder.

                        Camille Corot, 1865

        </figure>

        <p>The writer Théophile Thoré repeated his habitual criticism of
                Corot in 1865, the date of this picture: "Corot almost never
                made anything besides the same one landscape, but it is good."
                The landscape here was conceived by Corot in his studio from
                stock elements that he knew by heart: the cluster of silvery
                trees, the body of leaden water, the peasant figures and
                boatman, the distant tower. Like his idol Claude Lorrain, Corot
                could generate a landscape and a mood through the power of his
                imagination.

    <div class="washer">

                        Camille Pissarro, 1893
            </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Pissarro felt an affinity for the daily rhythms of peasant life
                that he witnessed around his home in the village of Eragny, not
                far from Paris. This washerwoman is hard at work, scrubbing
                linens and clothing in one barrel and rinsing them in another.
                The artist depicted the surrounding landscape with dappled
                touches of his brush—a legacy of the Pointillist style that he
                adopted in the mid-1880s. To suggest the effect of shimmering
                sunlight, he mixed pure yellow paint into the greens of the
                grass and trees while the pigment was still wet.
