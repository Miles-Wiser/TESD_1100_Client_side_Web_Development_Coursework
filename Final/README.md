## Ideas
- Museum
  + Display popular works of art on a "wall." When the user interacts with the art, information is provided.
- 3D Landscape
  + Set up rows of images on the z-axis, similar to a file sorter. Allow the user to file through them. All layers "in-front" of the current layer are "behind" the viewer and thus hidden.
  + Each layer shows something new. I.e:
    - a grassy knoll occupies layer 1. Layer 2 puts the viewer on top of the hill and can see many more layers. The viewer can see a deer grazing on the next layer and a     bird flying in the distance, ect. On layer 3, the deer is startled. Layer 4 shows the deer running away.
- Dungeon Crawler "Simulator"
  + The user travels through a maze. The perspective is locked. Much like the image. <img src="https://i.imgur.com/JDDTMB5.jpg" align=right width=250px height=auto>
  + Perhaps track health and monsters. Perhaps focus on the visuals. I.e. changing walls and/or landscapes.
