# TESD_1100_Client_side_Web_Development_Coursework

## Purpose
This holds all the coursework for TESD 1100: Client Side Web Development at Southwest Technical College. Assignments are seperated by chapter folders and come from "New Perspectives on HTML 5 and CSS: Comprehensive" by Patrick M. Carey.

A final project folder, as the name suggests, contains the final project for the course. It is the culmination of all material learned throughout the class.
